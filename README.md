- [ ] Background draggable area motion visibility
- [ ] Create dragging for widgets (whatever i am constructing the automata of)
- [ ] For dragging of widgets maybe spawn them within the area first and make them draggable there?
---
- [ ] Beware of backwards compatibility (Qt 6.9 vs Qt 5.5)
```cpp
#if QT_VERSION >= QT_VERSION_CHECK(6, 0, 0)
	// do something
#else
	// do something differently
#endif
```
