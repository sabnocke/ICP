comment: Simulation of a coffee machine with grinding, brewing, dispensing, and cleaning.
Input:
Output: status

Variables:
    int tIdle     = 2000
    int tGrind    = 3000
    int tBrew     = 4000
    int tDispense = 2000
    int tClean    = 5000
    int cycles    = 1
    int count     = 0
States:
    state IDLE     [ return "IDLE: waiting before cycle"; ]
    state GRIND    [ return "GRIND: grinding beans"; ]
    state BREW     [ return "BREW: brewing coffee"; ]
    state DISPENSE [ return "DISPENSE: dispensing into cup"; ]
    state CLEAN    [ count = count + 1; return "CLEAN: cleaning (" .. tonumber(count) .. "/" .. tonumber(cycles) .. ")"; ]
    state STOPPED  [ return "STOPPED: end of cycle"; ]
Transitions:
    IDLE     --> GRIND    : [ count < cycles ] @ tIdle
    IDLE     --> STOPPED  : [ count >= cycles ] @ tIdle
    GRIND    --> BREW     : @ tGrind
    BREW     --> DISPENSE : @ tBrew
    DISPENSE --> CLEAN    : @ tDispense
    CLEAN    --> IDLE     : [ count < cycles ] @ tClean
    CLEAN    --> STOPPED  : [ count >= cycles ] @ tClean
